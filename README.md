# wasm-regex

A very rudimentary demo of Rust's regex capabilities used in WASM. Follows [Mozilla's guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Rust_to_wasm).

## Running

First, if you don't already have it, install [wasm-pack](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack) with `cargo install wasm-pack`.

Next, inside the main folder, run `wasm-pack build`.

Install the necessary packages with `npm install`.

Finally, run `npm run serve` to get the site up and going locally.
